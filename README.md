# ML-to-predict-user-behaviour-on-marketplace---User-Actions-on-items
We are looking to take certain items from an online marketplace sold data and determine if we can use machine learning to accuratly predict if a user would take action on these items.

Currently, our users use our tool to search for items within certain criteria but do not buy everything that is found.

We will start with specific products in specific categories and try to work outwards from there.

The data we will use will be sold data from the marketplace over 90 days.

We don't exactly know what we'll find or if our approach is correct so it's helpful if you can also take the business objective and make recommendations to how we might want to conduct such a project.
===============================
Below is an approach to use machine learning for predicting user actions on items from an online marketplace. It includes Python code for the workflow along with recommendations for conducting the project.
Steps for the Project

    Define Objectives and Key Metrics:
        Objective: Predict the likelihood of a user taking action (click, save, or purchase) on an item.
        Metric: Use accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC-ROC as evaluation metrics based on the business goal.

    Data Collection:
        Gather 90 days of sold data from the marketplace.
        Include features such as item descriptions, category, price, location, user preferences, and timestamp of interactions.

    Data Preparation:
        Clean the dataset (e.g., handle missing values, encode categorical variables).
        Engineer features like user behavior trends or item popularity.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Understand patterns in the data (e.g., which categories or price ranges have higher interactions).
        Visualize trends to hypothesize relationships.

    Model Selection:
        Use machine learning models like logistic regression, random forests, or gradient boosting for tabular data.
        Deep learning models like neural networks can be explored for more complex relationships.

    Evaluation and Recommendations:
        Test multiple models and provide insights about feature importance and prediction accuracy.
        Suggest actions for users likely to convert.

Python Code

Here is a sample Python implementation:
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('marketplace_data.csv')

# Preprocess data
data['category'] = LabelEncoder().fit_transform(data['category'])
data['action'] = LabelEncoder().fit_transform(data['action'])

# Feature selection
features = ['price', 'category', 'location', 'item_popularity', 'user_behavior_score']
X = data[features]
y = data['action']

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Normalize features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

2. Model Training and Evaluation

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, roc_auc_score

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print(f"AUC-ROC: {roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred)}")

3. Feature Importance Analysis

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Feature importance
importance = model.feature_importances_
plt.bar(features, importance)
plt.title('Feature Importance')
plt.show()

Recommendations for Conducting the Project

    Start Narrow, Then Expand: Focus on a few categories and specific types of items to ensure feasibility and refine the model.

    Feature Engineering:
    Include time-based features (e.g., weekday vs. weekend activity) and user segmentation (e.g., new vs. returning users).

    Experiment with Advanced Models: Explore advanced techniques like XGBoost or LightGBM. If text data (e.g., descriptions) is involved, use NLP techniques with models like BERT.

    Iterate Based on Insights: Use feature importance to refine what data is collected or how it's engineered.

    Human Feedback Loop: Incorporate feedback from users or business analysts on the predictions to improve relevance.

    Deployment Plan: Use the model in production to suggest items and track user behavior, refining the model with real-world data.

This approach ensures a structured and iterative method to achieve actionable insights for predicting user behavior on marketplace items
